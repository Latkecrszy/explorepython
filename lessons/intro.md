# Introduction to Python
## What is Python?
Python is a high level programming language known for its concise, readable syntax and beginner friendliness.
Don't let the term 'high level' scare you though, being high level actually makes it easier!
A high level language is just a language that is more independent from the system it's running on.
This means that developers have an easier time getting set up and started.
Although sometimes regarded as a beginner only language, Python is used by professionals in a wide variety of applications and places, 
from machine learning, to website development, to web automation.
In fact, the website you're using right now was written using Python!

## Why would I learn Python?
In our increasingly digitized world, programming is becoming more and more of a profitable and useful profession.
The amazing thing about programming is that you don't need anything to get started - no materials, just some free software.
Python is a great way to get introduced to programming, and ExplorePython provides a fun and easy way to get started.

## Where do I start?
