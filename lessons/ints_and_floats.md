# Integers and Floats
## What are integers and floats?
As mentioned previously, an integer is a positive or negative whole number (like 1, or 10, or -3000).
But what is a float? Well, the name float is short for floating point number.
Floating point, put simply, means that it has a decimal point in the number.
While integers are whole numbers, floats are non-whole numbers, or decimals. 
For example, `20` is an integer, but `20.5` is a float.

## Can a whole number be a float?
Absolutely. `20` may be an integer, but `20.0` is a perfectly valid float. 
This is true for any integer, adding `.0` onto the end of it turns it into a float.
However, decimals can never be integers. There is no way to turn `20.5` into an integer without rounding up or down.

## How do I round a number in Python?
In Python, rounding numbers is super easy. All you need to do is use the builtin `round`! 
Here's an example: If I have `x = 5.7` and I want to round it up to 6, all I need to do is write `x = round(x)`. 
This will redefine `x` as the rounded value, which in this case is 6. 

## Your turn!
Now, you get to try your hand at making a float, and turning it into an integer with `round`. 
Start by creating a float variable, meaning a decimal. 
Then, use `round` to round it up or down so that it is an integer.
Finally, display the value of your variable at the bottom with `print`. 
If you need a refresher on how to make and use variables, feel free to refer back to the previous lessons for help.
Good luck!
