# Builtins
## What are builtins?
You may have noticed that we've been using `print()` in our previous code. 
You didn't know it at the time, but that was your first time using a builtin! 
A builtin is a function that is built-in to python and can be used automatically. So what is a function?
A function is a block of code takes input and then gives output, and can be used multiple times. 
`print()` is an example of a function. Its input, called parameters, goes inside the parenthesis.
This is why to print out a variable, we put its name inside the parenthesis after `print`. 
We'll learn how to make our own functions with input and output later, but right now we're dealing only with the builtins.

## Are there builtins besides print?
Of course! There are many builtins in python, about 69, and they all serve a unique purpose. 
Besides `print`, you'll also learn about `input`, `min`, `max`, `str`, `int`, and more. 
Right now, we're going to learn `input`.
`input` is a bit of an outlier in the builtin functions because it has two forms of output instead of just one. 
It both prints to the console and returns a value in the code. So, how does it do this?
The purpose of `input` is to take input from a user. 
So whatever we pass into its parenthesis will be printed into the console, and it will return whatever the user types in after.
Here's an example: if I ran the program `name = input("What is your name?")`, `"What is your name?"` would be printed in the console.
Then, after waiting for the user to enter something and press enter, `name` would be defined as whatever they put in.

## You try!
It's your turn to try taking user input with `input`! You'll notice that there is no code in the box to start with.
As you progress through the lessons, code will become more sparse as you become more skilled at writing your own.
You're always free to refer back to previous lessons for their code examples as well. Your program should
