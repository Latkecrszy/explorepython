# Variables
## What is a variable?
You may remember that in math, a variable is a letter that stands for a number. In programming, a variable is very similar. 
Variables are containers for pieces of information, whether that information is numbers, letters, or anything else.
They are fundamental to python and programming in general, which is why we're becoming familiar with them at the very beginning.
Here's an example: If I wanted to make `x` equal to `10` in my program, I would write `x = 10`. 
This tells python that in this program, whenever I put `x`, it is equal to `10`. 
## Why would I use variables?
Variables aren't just limited to numbers. There are many data types in python, 
like strings (letters, numbers, and other characters), integers (whole numbers), floats (decimals), booleans (True or False values), lists (collections of other data types), and more. 
We'll go over each of these data types in depth later, but they all can be stored in variables. 
Variables are used to store data in a program. Instead of directly referencing `10` each time, it's much easier to 
place it in a variable, like `x`, and use the variable instead. 

## You try!
Now, it's your turn! In the box on the upper right, you'll see that one line is incomplete - we're starting to make a variable, but it has no value! 
Fill in this value with a number of your choice, and then click `Run` to see if the resulting code is valid. 
Then, you can click the `Next` button to move onto the next lesson.
